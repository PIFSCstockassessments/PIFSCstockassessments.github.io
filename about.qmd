The Assessment & Research (A&R) Branch is part of the Fisheries Research and Monitoring Division (FRMD) at the Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC).

We bring together three core programs—Life History, Fisheries-Independent Surveys, and Stock Assessment—to provide the scientific foundation for sustainable fisheries management in the Pacific Islands Region.

Our work spans life history research, population biology, fisheries surveys, and stock assessment. By integrating biological studies with advanced analytical tools and field surveys, we deliver high-quality science that supports both domestic and international fisheries management..
