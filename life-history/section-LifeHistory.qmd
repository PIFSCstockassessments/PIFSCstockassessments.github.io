Understanding how fish grow, reproduce, and survive is essential for science‑based fisheries management. The Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center’s Life History Program studies the age, growth, reproductive biology, and other key traits of fish species across Hawai‘i, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Fieldwork includes research cruises aboard the NOAA Ship *Oscar Elton Sette* and collaborations with local fishers to collect the biological data that form the foundation of accurate population models and stock assessments (Visit [here](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/pacific-islands/population-assessments/fish-life-history-research-pacific?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

**Research Highlights**

-   Determine the age and growth of key species through otolith (ear bone) and spine analysis.

-   Study reproductive cycles and spawning seasons to understand stock productivity.

-   Collect length, weight, and maturity data to improve life history parameter estimates for coastal and pelagic species.

Support stock assessments and survey design by providing high‑quality biological inputs. These studies ensure that fisheries management in the Pacific Islands is grounded in strong biological science, supporting sustainable harvests and resilient ecosystems.
