-   **Bottomfish Fishery‑Independent Surveys (BFISH)**: Conducted around the Main Hawaiian Islands and Guam to estimate bottomfish abundance and size distribution.

-   **Creel Surveys**: Ongoing in Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) to collect catch and effort data from local fishers.

-   **Hawaii Marine Recreational Fishing Survey (HMRFS)**: Monitors recreational fishing activity and catch around the Hawaiian Islands.

These surveys form the foundation of our fisheries science, enabling a better understanding of fish populations and supporting effective management decisions.
