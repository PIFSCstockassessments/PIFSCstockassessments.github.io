    "text": "The ukupalu snapper, more commonly known as uku, is found throughout the Hawaiian Archipelago (the northwestern and main Hawaiian Islands) at depths of 60 to 650 feet. Uku have been fished for hundreds of years in the Hawaiian Archipelago region. It is a particularly important resource for recreational and subsistence fishers; these fisheries account for over half of the total annual uku catches, at 50 and 100 mt per year.\nThe commercial fishery has experienced increases and declines in catches since the 1950s but since the 1990s have been steadily increasing to approximately 50 mt per year around 2015. Recently, the commerical catch has declined to around 25 mt per year. The most common fishing method is deep-sea handline with baited hooks. Currently, the MHI stock is jointly managed by the State of Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources and NOAA.\nBefore 2017, the MHI uku stock was assessed as a part of a snapper complex. Starting in 2020, uku is now assessed as a single-species using the statistical catch-at-age model Stock Synthesis (version 3.30). The model incorporated both fishery-dependent and fishery-independent data.\nFishery-dependent data included individual weights, catch, and catch-per-unit-effort data from the commercial fishery for the years 1948 to 2018 and recreational catch data from the Hawai’i Marine Recreational Fishing Survey for the years 2003 to 2018.\nThe fishery-independent index of relative abundance data was from the Pacific Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program for the years 2005 to 2016.\nThe assessment was the first successful implementation of an integrated Stock Synthesis model in Hawai’i and marks a milestone for the stock assessment program and the future of conservation of marine resources in Hawai’i. A 2024 update to the 2020 benchmark mark assessment confirmed that the current status of the stock is not overfished, with no overfishing occuring.",

In the North Pacific, the Western and Central North Pacific Ocean (WCNPO) stock is conventionally defined as occurring north of the Equator (0°) and west of 150°W within the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) Convention Area.\nStriped marlin are predominantly taken as incidental catch in pelagic longline fisheries targeting tunas and swordfish, mainly by fleets from Japan, the United States, Korea, and Chinese Taipei, with additional catch from China and other WCPFC members. Catches were highest from the 1970s through the 1990s and were largely associated with large-scale high-seas driftnet fleets. Since the 1990s most landings have come from longline fleets, with overall catches declining.\nBecause striped marlin are highly migratory and cross international boundaries, stock assessments are conducted through international scientific bodies. The International Scientific Committee for Tuna and Tuna-like Species in the North Pacific Ocean (ISC) Billfish Working Group (BILLWG) assesses the Western and Central North Pacific Ocean striped marlin stock.

    "text": "Pacific blue marlin (Makaira nigricans) are found in tropical and subtropical waters of the Pacific Ocean and assessed as a single stock within the Pacific Ocean. Blue marlin are predominantly caught by Japanese, Korean, and Taiwanese high seas longline fisheries. In the 1950s and 1960s, bycatch of blue marlin in Japanese longline fisheries represented the largest portion of blue marlin take. In more recent years, Japanese efforts have decreased while efforts by Taiwanese and other Indo-Pacific countries (Korea, China, Indonesia, and French Polynesia) have increased.\nBecause of the species’ wide range and long-distance migrations, the stock is assessed by the International Scientific Committee for Tuna and Tuna-like Species in the North Pacific (ISC) Billfish Working Group (BILLWG), which is a collaborative effort between multinational and multi-regional fisheries management organizations that conducts assessments and provides scientific advice for swordfish and marlin species.\nThe most recent benchmark assessment was developed in 2021. The 2021 assessment consisted of two age-, length-, and sex-structured Stock Synthesis models that incorporated sex-specific growth and natural mortality rates to account for sexual dimorphism of adults, each using a different growth curve for Pacific blue marlin.\nAfter extensive model exploration, neither growth curve could be excluded due to model diagnostics, model fit, nor biological plausibility. Therefore, the best fit model using each growth curve was averaged to produce stock status and conservation information.\nThe assessment models included time-series data from 1971 to 2019 catch, relative abundance, and length and weight composition from multiple fisheries), and biological information.",

    "text": "Kona crabs (Ranina ranina, also known as “spanner crabs”) are found throughout the tropical and subtropical Indo-Pacific region including around the Main Hawaiian Islands in waters of 2-200 m depth. Kona crabs have been commercially fished in Hawai’i since the beginning of the 20th century and are caught using baited hoop nets deployed over sandy substrates.The current annual catch limit (ACL) for Kona crab in the main Hawaiian Islands is 30,802 lb based on results from the latest stock assessment (Kapur et al. 2019). The 2018 Kona crab assessment used a state-space Bayesian framework that fit standardized CPUE data in a generalized Pella-Tomlinson surplus production model using Just Another Bayesian Biomass Assessment Just Another Bayesian Biomass Assessment (JABBA).\nIn the years since the assessment, the annual commercial catch was always less than 6,000 lb, well below the ACL. The commercial catch reported from inshore reporting areas (extending to ~2 nautical miles from shore) accounted for more than 80% of the total commercial catch in 2014-2024. Before then, catch from Penguin Bank (&gt; 3 nautical miles from shore, in federal waters) accounted for 50% of the total catch. However, there was minimal catch reported from Penguin Bank since 2014 and catch from federal waters as a whole was minor. The inshore reporting areas for the Hawaii DAR Commercial Fisher Reporting System (FRS) only extend to about 2 nautical miles from shore and do not include all state waters, which extend to 3 nautical miles from shore. The actual annual catch in state waters may have accounted for ~90% or more of the total catch in 2014-2024. Considering the recent low annual commercial catch (average of 3,400 lb or 10% of ACL) and the small proportion of total catch in federal waters, an update stock assessment for Kona crab may not be warranted at this time.",

These seven species are found around the Main Hawaiian Islands (MHI) in waters of 100-400 m depth.\nThe Deep 7 species have historical cultural significance in Hawaiian tradition and today they comprise a significant part of the domestic commercial catch, with reported catches ranging from about 200,000 lbs to 300,000 lbs per year. Although the efficiency of the modern fishery has likely improved through time, the current Hawaii bottomfish fishery still uses traditional deep handline capture methods for commercial and recreational harvest. The stock is jointly managed by the from the State of Hawaii Division of Aquatic Resources (DAR) and NOAA.\nThe latest benchmark assessment was developed in 2024. The assessment used a Bayesian surplus production model that fit annual biomass estimates to bottomfish catch and effort data (CPUE) and commercial catch reports for fishing years 1949-2023 in addition to fishery-independent survey data starting in fishing year 2017.\nSome significant changes implemented with the 2024 benchmark assessment include the re-examination of previously used reporting ratios for determining non-commercial catch, refining data filtering procedures and improving the generation of abundance indices (i.e., the standardized fishery-dependent CPUE index, fishery-independent index, and single-species ’ōpakapaka CPUE index), updating the software for the assessment model, exploring new parameterizations of the production function, and reevaluating prior distributions based on the most recent life-history information available for Deep 7 species.\nThe benchmark assessment indicated the main Hawaiian Islands Deep 7 complex was not overfished or undergoing overfishing in 2023.",

Swordfish have high economic value in both commercial and recreational fisheries and are primarily caught with longline fishing gear. Catch was historically greater in the WCNPO than the NEPO, since 2011, annual catches are approximately 10,000 mt for both areas.\nSwordfish are highly migratory species and cross international boundaries, which necessitates the need to assess their populations on an international scale. The North Pacific swordfish stocks are assessed by the International Scientific Committee for Tuna and Tuna-like Species in the North Pacific (ISC) Billfish working group (BILLWG), which is a collaborative effort between multinational and multi-regional fisheries management organizations that conducts assessments and provides scientific advice for swordfish and marlin species.\nThe most recent benchmark stock assessment for the WCNPO swordfish stock was conducted in 2023. The assessment model was an integrated, age- and sex-structured model in Stock Synthesis. It included best-available catch, catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE), and length composition data from 1975 to 2021.

Fishing is an integral part of the heritage, tradition, and culture of the local communities in these Pacific Islands.\nMost bottomfishing has traditionally been done with hook-and-lines from small boats with outboard engines, primarily for subsistence or local sale. In recent decades, technology and the increased presence of larger vessels have allowed the fisheries to expand offshore into deeper waters around the islands. BMUS were previously managed as a multi-species complex in each jurisdiction by the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council, but the most recent benchmark stock assessment in American Samoa was conducted at the species level.

These species are targeted by a small yet valuable boat-based fishery in depths ranging around 100 m to 400 m.\nThe current benchmark assessment for the American Samoa BMUS developed in 2023 differs significantly from all previous efforts. A major improvement for the 2023 benchmark was to move to single-species, age-structured models. The 2023 assessments integrated catch, an abundance index, and length data from four data sources: historical catches (pre-1986) from older reports; recent catches (post-1985) from boat- and shore-based creel surveys; length compositions from boat-based creel surveys and the biosampling program; and an abundance index from boat-based creel survey interviews.\nOf note, two of the eleven bottomfish species could not be assessed due to either the presence of a confounded species in the data (E.carbunculus) or insufficient data (P. filamentosus). For these two species, we used indicator species from the 9 assessed bottomfishes. The species used as indicators were E. coruscans and P. flavipinnis.\nThe stock status in the terminal year (2021) for all nine bottomfish species was not overfished and that overfishing was not occurring (see figure below). Overfishing is defined by fishing mortality (F) in 2021 being higher than FMSY and overfished status is defined by spawning stock biomass (SSB) in 2021 being lower than SSB at the Minimum Stock Size Threshold.\n Stock status in 2021 of the nine BMUS species with single-species assessment models in the terminal year of the model.",
