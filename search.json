Uku have been fished for hundreds of years in the Hawaiian Archipelago region. It is a particularly important resource for recreational and subsistence fishers; these fisheries accounting for over half of the total annual uku catches, at approximately 55 mt per year.\nThe commercial fishery has experienced increases and declines in catches since the 1950s but since the 1990s have been steadily increasing to approximately 50 mt per year. The most common fishing method is deep-sea handline with baited hooks. Currently, the MHI stock is jointly managed by the State of Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources and NOAA.\nPrior to 2017, the MHI uku stock was assessed as a part of a snapper complex. The most recent assessment in 2020 was a single-species assessment that used the statistical catch-at-age model Stock Synthesis (version 3.30). The model incorporated both fishery-dependent and fishery-independent data.\nFishery-dependent data included individual weights, catch, and catch-per-unit-effort data from the commercial fishery for the years 1948 to 2018 and recreational catch data from the Hawai’i Marine Recreational Fishing Survey for the years 2003 to 2018.\nThe fishery-independent index of relative abundance data was from the Pacific Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program for the years 2005 to 2016.\nThe assessment was the first successful implementation of an integrated Stock Synthesis model in Hawai’i and marks a milestone for the stock assessment program and the future of conservation of marine resources in Hawai’i.\n\nNadon, Marc O.; Sculley, Michelle; Carvalho, Felipe. 2020.

Catch of striped marlin were highest in the 1970s to the 1990s and were mostly by driftnet, but since the 1990s, they have been primarily caught by longlines and overall catches have decreased.\nBecause striped marlin are highly migratory species and cross international boundaries, their populations are assessed on an international scale.

    "text": "The Hawaiian “Deep 7” bottomfish complex is comprised of six snapper and one grouper species: opakapaka (pink snapper), onaga (longtail snapper), ehu (squirrelfish snapper), kalekale (Von Siebold’s snapper), gindai (Brigham’s snapper), lehi (silverjaw snapper), and hapu’upu’u (Hawaiian grouper). These seven species are found around the Main Hawaiian Islands (MHI) in waters of 100-400 m depth.\nThe Deep 7 species have historical cultural significance in Hawaiian tradition and today they comprise a significant part of the domestic commercial catch, with reported catches ranging from about 200,000 lbs to 300,000 lbs per year. Although the efficiency of the modern fishery has likely improved through time, the current Hawaii bottomfish fishery still uses traditional deep handline capture methods for commercial and recreational harvest. The stock is jointly managed by the from the State of Hawaii Division of Aquatic Resources (DAR) and NOAA.\nThe latest benchmark assessment was developed in 2018 and updated in 2021. The 2018 benchmark assessment was the first instance of incorporating data from the annual Bottomfish Fishery-Independent Survey into the stock assessment model. The assessment used a Bayesian surplus production model that fit annual biomass estimates to bottomfish catch and effort data (CPUE) and commercial catch reports for fishing years 1949-2015 in addition to fishery-independent survey data for fishing year 2017. The 2021 assessment update used the same Bayesian surplus production model with three additional years of data for each data source.",

    "text": "Stock assessment is at the core of NOAA’s science‑based fisheries management, and it is the primary mission of the Stock Assessment Program (SAP) at the Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC).\nSAP evaluates the current and historical status of fish and invertebrate populations in the Western Pacific, providing the scientific foundation for sustainable fisheries management.\nDomestically, SAP conducts stock assessments for bottomfish and crustaceans in support of the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council (WPRFMC). These assessments inform Annual Catch Limits (ACLs) for U.S. fisheries in the region.\nInternationally, SAP plays a leading role in U.S. participation in Regional Fishery Management Organizations (RFMOs). Our primary focus is on the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) and the International Scientific Committee for Tuna and Tuna‑like Species in the North Pacific Ocean (ISC), where our scientists conduct collaborative stock assessments for tuna, billfish, and shark stocks - fisheries worth billions of dollars and vital to the Pacific Islands’ economy.\nSAP scientists frequently serve as lead analysts and working group chairs in these efforts. We also contribute to the science that underpins the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organization (SPRFMO) and the North Pacific Fisheries Commission (NPFC).",

    "text": "The North Pacific swordfish (Xiphias gladius) stock is divided into two sub-stocks, the Western and Central North Pacific Ocean sub-stock and the North Eastern Pacific Ocean sub-stock, by a diagonal boundary line from Baja, California to the equator, but are assessed as a single stock with the spatial component modeled implicitly using fleets-as-areas. Swordfish have high economic value in both commercial and recreational fisheries and are primarily caught with longline fishing gear. Catch was historically greater in the WCNPO than the NEPO, since 2011, annual catches are approximately 10,000 mt for both areas.\nSwordfish are highly migratory species and cross international boundaries, which necessitates the need to assess their populations on an international scale. The North Pacific swordfish stocks are assessed by the International Scientific Committee for Tuna and Tuna-like Species in the North Pacific (ISC) Billfish working group (BILLWG), which is a collaborative effort between multinational and multi-regional fisheries management organizations that conducts assessments and provides scientific advice for swordfish and marlin species.\nThe most recent benchmark stock assessment for the WCNPO swordfish stock was conducted in 2023. The assessment model was an integrated, age- and sex-structured model in Stock Synthesis. It included best-available catch, catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE), and length composition data from 1975 to 2021. This assessment indicated that the stock was not overfished and that overfishing was not occuring according to MSY-based reference points.",

    "text": "The U.S. Jurisdictional bottomfishes are 14 coastal species primarily found in deep-slope habitat around American Samoa, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). Eleven of these species occur around American Samoa and 13 occur in the Mariana Archipelago. These species are mainly deep snappers from the Etelis and Pristipomoides genre, in addition to a few emperor, grouper, and jack species. Fishing is an integral part of the heritage, tradition, and culture of the local communities in these Pacific Islands.\nMost bottomfishing has traditionally been done with hook-and-lines from small boats with outboard engines, primarily for subsistence or local sale. In recent decades, technology and the increased presence of larger vessels have allowed the fisheries to expand offshore into deeper waters around the islands. These species were previously managed as a multi-species complex by the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council, but recent analyses have been conducted at the species level in certain jurisdiction (American Samoa).",

These species are targeted by a small yet valuable boat-based fishery in depths ranging around 100 m to 400 m.\nThe current benchmark assessment for the American Samoa BMUS developed in 2023 differs significantly from all previous efforts. A major improvement for the 2023 benchmark was to move to single-species, age-structured models. The 2023 assessments integrated catch, an abundance index, and length data from four data sources: historical catches (pre-1986) from older reports; recent catches (post-1985) from boat- and shore-based creel surveys; length compositions from boat-based creel surveys and the biosampling program; and an abundance index from boat-based creel survey interviews.\nOf note, two of the eleven bottomfish species could not be assessed due to either the presence of a confounded species in the data (E.carbunculus) or insufficient data (P. filamentosus). For these two species, we used indicator species from the 9 assessed bottomfishes. The species used as indicators were E. coruscans and P. flavipinnis.\nThe stock status in the terminal year (2021) for all nine bottomfish species was not overfished and that overfishing was not occurring (see figure below). Overfishing is defined by fishing mortality (F) in 2021 being higher than FMSY and overfished status is defined by spawning stock biomass (SSB) in 2021 being lower than SSB at the Minimum Stock Size Threshold.\n Stock status in 2021 of the nine BMUS species with single-species assessment models in the terminal year of the model.",
