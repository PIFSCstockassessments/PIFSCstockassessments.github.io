[**Stock assessment**](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/topic/population-assessments#fish-stocks) is at the core of NOAA’s science‑based fisheries management, and it is the primary mission of the Stock Assessment Program (SAP) at the Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC).

SAP evaluates the current and historical status of fish and invertebrate populations in the Western Pacific, providing the scientific foundation for sustainable fisheries management.

Domestically, SAP conducts stock assessments for bottomfish and crustaceans in support of the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council (WPRFMC). These assessments inform Annual Catch Limits (ACLs) for U.S. fisheries in the region.

Internationally, SAP plays a leading role in U.S. participation in Regional Fishery Management Organizations (RFMOs). Our primary focus is on the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) and the International Scientific Committee for Tuna and Tuna‑like Species in the North Pacific Ocean (ISC), where our scientists conduct collaborative stock assessments for tuna, billfish, and shark stocks - fisheries worth billions of dollars and vital to the Pacific Islands' economy.

SAP scientists frequently serve as lead analysts and working group chairs in these efforts. We also contribute to the science that underpins the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organization (SPRFMO) and the North Pacific Fisheries Commission (NPFC).
