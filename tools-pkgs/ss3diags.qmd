ss3diags is an R package with advanced diagnostics to evaluate a Stock Synthesis model. Diagnostics include residual analyses, hindcasting and cross-validation techniques, and retrospective analyses

The R package ss3diags enables users to apply advanced diagnostics to evaluate a [Stock Synthesis](https://github.com/nmfs-stock-synthesis/stock-synthesis) model. Diagnostics include residual analyses, hindcasting and cross-validation techniques, and retrospective analyses. ss3diags also allow users to reproduce the key model diagnostics plots that presented in the paper [*A Cookbook for Using Model Diagnostics in Integrated Stock Assessments*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2021.105959).
