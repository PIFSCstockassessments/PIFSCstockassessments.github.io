:::

The R package ss3diags enables users to apply advanced diagnostics to evaluate a [Stock Synthesis](https://github.com/nmfs-stock-synthesis/stock-synthesis) model. Key functions include running and visualizations of diagnostic tests such as residual analyses, hindcasting cross-validation techniques, and retrospective analyses, as presented in the paper [*A Cookbook for Using Model Diagnostics in Integrated Stock Assessments*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2021.105959). The package works closely with [r4ss](https://github.com/r4ss/r4ss) to make a seamless workflow for the users to evaluate the statistical robustness of their stock assessment model.
